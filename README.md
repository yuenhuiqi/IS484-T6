## Project Description
Citi Commercial Bank (CCB) plans to hire hundreds of staff over the next three years to fast-track growth. It is crucial that new hires joining CCB are brought up to speed efficiently on company and role-specific processes and day-to-day functions. A large part of this is done through on-the-job training, where new hires learn more about the various processes, digital platforms and resources as they do their daily work. However, given the complex nature of the business (and hence its processes and systems), it is not always easy for new hires to learn on-the-job. The ask is to create on-the-job training resource(s) and platform for employees where Line Managers / L&D partners can easily:
- Build learning pathways for their teams on the various digital processes and systems that they would have to get familiar with as part of their on-the-job training.
- Upload / maintain use-case driven content for the learning pathways.
- Reduce manual on-the-job trainings for new hires.
